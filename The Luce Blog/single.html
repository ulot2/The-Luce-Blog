					There are some people you can never take serious, because of your first impression of them. You might have been known for a wrong reason all your life and you're trying to make a different name for yourself, how do you take a life-changing step?
					<br><br>
					I've decided to share a personal story. I was one of those who were technologically inclined very early in life, and was influenced a lot by social media. When I was 14/15, I had built a reasonable Facebook presence and was getting hundreds of likes per post, to an extent I was being asked if I was using automatic likes or bots, lol. I wasn't the biggest sensation on the internet, there were people I wanted to be like, all for no important reason than a strong fan base/audience. And so much exposure can get into a young girl's head. But even back then, I was selective with my circle, selective with friend requests I accept. I was a 'big girl' and I tagged myself 'woke'.
					<br><br>
					I met 90% of my friends online, took active part in Facebook banters and was well known for my 'sharp mouth'. No one could beat me in an argument. It was controversial with a lot of bad blood, but I wasn't bothered. It took up my time and I was 'busy'.
					<br><br>
					All of a sudden, it started to get boring, someone asked me if I could do something important with the audience I had built. I was told to start posting reasonable stuff and not just pictures with the hashtag '#GOE'. To be honest, I thought about it and I knew even if I did it, my audience wouldn't be interested in it, this wasn't the impression I had built and my likes would definitely decrease. So, I continued giving them the content I thought they wanted.
					<br><br>
					When I got to SS3, I was introduced to a 'different' part of Facebook. By different, I mean people who were actually doing something relevant and were successful about it. I had been on the mediocre part of Facebook all this while.
					These people had audience, in thousands, far bigger than I had. I wanted that, but deep down I was scared. I thought if I started posting stuff different from what I was used to, I wouldn't be taken serious at all. Moreover, the internet never forgets.
					<br><br>
					<b><u>Putting the pieces together.</u></b>
					<br><br>
					<img src="images/pieces.jpg" class="singlepost-image pieces" alt="pieces.jpg">
					<br><br>
					After my WAEC, I took a 'giant' step. I deleted that particular Facebook account, I wanted to be known for something else, to be relevant. I waited for a few weeks before creating another account, my current one. By then, I had lost the major part of my audience.
					<br><br>
					By the time I left secondary school, I had a re-defined personality. People no longer associated me with rubbish. I took part in no online banters, I joined zero groups. I stopped accepting requests from just anyone. I followed a different part of the internet, the part I wanted to be associated with. I'm selective with posts I comment on and it is a different world.
					<br><br>
					On the internet, the entire world is watching you, as you will realise if you are on that journey to relevance.
					You attract the same energy you give off, and you will be regarded as what you portray yourself as, with the people you associate yourself with.
					A faulty foundation can only hold a faulty structure unless that foundation is rebuilt. Sometimes, but not always, a total personality overhaul is inevitable.
					Social media is a gift, and an opportunity, use it wisely. Do your your social media accounts reflect the person you want to be? Would you rather be regarded as sexy, but brainless?
					<br><br>
					Why do you think celebrities are made brand ambassadors? It is simple, they sell!
					It is the same with you. When people know who you are, they will be able to vouch for you, based on the kind of person you portray yourself as.
					<br><br>
					The world is digital. Give your kids bragging rights to parents who have influenced others positively.
					<br><br>
					And start today.
